# java9-samples

## API changes

1. Stream API:
   1. iterate-filter-consumer
   2. Stream vs Optional: Optional is a special kind of stream
2. process API
3. HTTP Client API: implements HTTP/2 & WebSocket
## New language features
1. Try-with-resources example
2. Underscore example: what's in it for the future
3. private interface methods
4. Collection Factory methods
## New Deployment strategy
1. Java 8 vs Java 9 ways, memory footprints
## What's deprecated
## Tech debt
1. Current naming convention of samples doesn't scale; needs a round of refactor
2. Interplay between LOGGER and sysout is turning out to be hairy; refactor
3. The stream examples are all in one class, should be in a package of their own
